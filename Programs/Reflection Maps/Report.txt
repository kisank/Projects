CS541_Project 4

The project was to implement the reflection maps using the lighting and shadow mapping done in the previous projects.
The project was implemented using the previous project. The light position is too far from the scene so there are no
reflections and shadow at the beginning. Once the light is zoomed in the reflections are seen on the teapot.
Reflections dont need good light position as the shadows required in the previous projects however, for the 
reflection of the shadows it is important to get a good lighting position.

In this project, I used two fbos with 1024X1024 size. I did the project with 512X512 as I read somewhere that
too many fbos with big sizes may reduce the efficiency of the program, however since this is just 3 my guess 
is that it would work fine without any problem. Other than this I followed the handout and made some minor
changes in the project code so the output looks fine. For the generation pass I used 1.0 instead of 0.9 for
the calculation of the upper half of the teapot. I had to use a small shift for both the half because the 
reflections were getting bloked by some other objects.

While calculating the reflection, the teapot is not considered and that is done in object.cpp. I probably
removed the sky from the scene as it was leaving a black line on the teapot during reflection and I think it
did not look good. Because of this I could see two different reflections occuring in the scene with the black
line separating them and after removing it the reflection looks more natural.
